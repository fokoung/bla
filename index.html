                                In this study, we tested a newly developed web application designed to simulate students model in practice. The goal was to gather insights into its usability and potential for teaching and learning purposes, with a focus on usability, user experience, and knowledge acquisition. This study aims to contribute to the development of educational tools that enhance the understanding and application of cognitive models in educational settings.
